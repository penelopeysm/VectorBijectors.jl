# VectorBijectors.jl

A lightweight reimplementation of Bijectors.jl's functionality, but specifically focused on transformations to and from vectors.

It assumes that there are three forms of samples from a distribution `d` that we are interested in:

1. **The original form**, which is what `rand(d)` returns.
2. **A vectorised form**, which is a vector that contains a flattened version of the original form.
3. **A linked vectorised form**, which is a vector in which:
   - each element is independent; and
   - each element is unconstrained (can take any value in ℝ).

Note that because of the independence requirement, the linked vectorised form may have a different dimension to the vectorised form.
For example, when sampling from a `Dirichlet` distribution, the original form is a vector that always sums to 1.
The linked vectorised form will have one element less than the original form, because this constraint is eliminated.

VectorBijectors.jl provides functionality to convert between these three forms, via the following functions.
Assuming that `x = rand(d)` for some distribution `d`:

- `to_vec(d)` is a function which converts `x` to the vectorised form
- `from_vec(d)` is the inverse of `to_vec(d)`
- `vec_length(d)` returns the length of `to_vec(d)(x)`
- `to_linked_vec(d)` is a function which converts `x` to the linked vectorised form
- `from_linked_vec(d)` is the inverse of `to_linked_vec(d)`
- `linked_vec_length(d)` returns the length of `to_linked_vec(d)(x)`

For example:

```julia
julia> using VectorBijectors, Distributions

julia> d = Beta(2, 2); x = rand(d)  # x is between 0 and 1
0.5602086057097567

julia> to_vec(d)(x)
1-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.5602086057097567

julia> to_linked_vec(d)(x)
1-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.24200871395677753
```

VectorBijectors also implements `ChangesOfVariables.with_logabsdet_jacobian(f, x)`, where `f` is some transform obtained from `to_vec`, `from_vec`, `to_linked_vec`, or `from_linked_vec`.

It also implements `InverseFunctions.inverse(f)`, but this is not tested.
Use at your own risk (and PRs to add tests for this are welcome!).

## Why not Bijectors?

This package is intended primarily for use with probabilistic programming, e.g. DynamicPPL.jl, where vectorised samples are required to satisfy the LogDensityProblems.jl interface.
Note that Bijectors.jl is a more general package that contains far more functionality than this.

Bijectors.jl does indeed contain very similar functionality, but it does not guarantee that `Bijectors.bijector(d)(x)` will always return a vector (in general it can be a scalar or an array).
Thus, there is often extra overhead introduced when converting to and from vectorised forms.
See e.g. https://github.com/TuringLang/DynamicPPL.jl/issues/1142.
